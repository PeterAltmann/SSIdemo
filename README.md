# Authentic Copmany Data

This text aims to document the design process with the Authentic Company Data project at Bolagsverket. Digital identity is rapidly evolving. Open source projects like Hyperledger Aries and Ursa projects provide a set of protocols that, when paired with DLTs such as Hyperledger Indy or Besu, can be used for building distributed applications built on authentic and secure data.

The text assumes a high level familiarity with the [Trust over IP concept](https://trustoverip.org/toip-model/). The Linux Foundation added ToIP in to its projects in 2020. The mission of the ToIP foundation is to simplify and standardize how trust is established online, i.e., to provide mechanisms for how interacting entities can trust the credential exchanges they are engaged in. At its core, the ToIP introduces three actors: an issuer of credentials, a holder of credentials, and a verifier of credentials. The concept introduces a technology and governance stack that affors a very high degree of privacy and user control to the credential holder. The ToIP concept can be viewed as an alternative to existing centralized and federated identity models where the user has very limited control over their online idenity and data. The concept relies heavily on [the Verifiable Credentials data model](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/).

## Objectives

The specific objectives of this text is to use a series of labs to demonstrate how Verifiable Credentials (or equivalent authenticated data) works and to motivate design choices along the way. This text will focus primarily on Layers 1-3 on the ToIP technology stack. Where necessary, we use default settings for the governance stacks. More specifically,

* Layer 1: establishing cryptographic roots of trust labs:
  1. How to establish a secure and privacy connection between two actors.
  2. How to verify the identity of the party you are connecting to.
  3. Explain the governance choices necessary to enable technical trust on Layer 1.
* Layer 2: the agent labs:
  1. How to implement digital wallets and agents
* Layer 3: data exchange labs
  1. Offering, requesting, and creating verifiable credentials
  2. Verifying verifiable credentials
